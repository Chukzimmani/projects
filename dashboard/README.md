# 🌍 World Energy Consumption Dashboard

Welcome to the World Energy Consumption Dashboard! This project aims to create an interactive dashboard by integrating `hvplot` with `Panel`. The purpose is to demonstrate the power of Python in visualizing data and exploring world energy consumption patterns.

## 📊 Overview

The World Energy Consumption Dashboard provides a comprehensive visualization of energy consumption trends and patterns across different countries and continents. The following visualizations are included:

1. **📈 Line Graph: Energy Consumption Over Time**: This line graph showcases the energy consumption trends over time. It allows users to analyze the changes in energy consumption patterns and identify any significant fluctuations.

2. **🔁 Scatterplot: Energy Consumption VS GDP**: This scatterplot explores the relationship between energy consumption and GDP (Gross Domestic Product). It enables users to understand the correlation between these two variables and identify potential insights.

3. **📊 Bar Graph: Energy Sources by Continent**: The bar graph presents a breakdown of energy sources by continent. It provides a visual representation of the energy mix across different regions, highlighting the dominant energy sources on each continent.

4. **🗃️ Interactive Table**: An interactive table, created using `tabular`, provides a comprehensive overview of energy consumption statistics by country. Users can sort, filter, and search through the table to explore specific countries or regions of interest.

## 🛠️ Data Processing

Before visualizing the data, some data processing steps were performed to prepare the dataset. One of the preprocessing steps involved creating a new column called "gdp_per_capita" to calculate the GDP per capita for each country. This additional information allows for a deeper analysis and comparison of energy consumption patterns in relation to economic indicators.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

The World Energy Consumption Dashboard is built using the following technologies:

- Python: The programming language used for data processing, visualization, and dashboard creation.
- `hvplot`: A Python library used to generate interactive visualizations.
- `Panel`: A powerful framework for building interactive dashboards and web applications.
- `tabular`: A Python library used to create interactive tables for data exploration.

Enjoy exploring the World Energy Consumption Dashboard and discovering insights from the data! 🌟
